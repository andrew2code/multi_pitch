# The Best Multi Pitch Routes in the World

## Introduction

There is a great crowd-sourced website for climbers called Mountainproject.com. I have always thought that the search feature could be better. This project will attempt to solve for the best multi pitch routes in the world, using Pandas data analysis.

## Data Dictionary

| Route | This is the name of the route given by the person who first set the route |

| Average Stars | This is the rating of the climb in terms of its enjoyment and overall fun experience factor |
| Number of Pitches | The climber ascends in between sections of the rock that allow him to reuse the rope repeatedly. The longer the climb, the more pitches. A typical rope is 70 meters long. If a route is 15 pitches long, then the route is roughly 1,050 meters long |
| Length(f) | Length in feet |
| Length (m) | Length in meters |

| Protection Rating | This is an optional rating that rates the spacing of the protection and the quality of the protection for a lead climber. 
PG: Good protection, a few places of poor or non-existent placements
PG13: Fair protection, falls may be long (15 feet) but a less likely to cause serious injury
R: Some placements very far apart and a fall could result in broken bones, even when protection is placed
X: No protection, very dangerous or a fall that could result in death even when properly protected |
| Aid Climbing Grading | This applies only for Aid Climbing, the higher the number, the more difficult it is to place protection
